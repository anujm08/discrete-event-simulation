To compile the code run `make`
To run the code run `./simulation < input-file`
The format of input file can be seen from file input-format
Some sample input are present in directory sample-input

Script `test.sh` generates sample inputs in directory `input`,
runs them and generate output file in directory `output` and
gives consolidates results in file `results.txt`. It uses the
file `randomseeds.txt` for seeds of different testcases. The
seeds have been included for reproducibility of exact results

Python Code `plot.py` uses this result file to generate plots
in directory `graphs`
